## [0.9.0] Modern Cleanup - 2025-03-12
Initial release after forking from LightnCandy 1.2.6.

### Added
- New `compile` method which takes a template string and options and returns an executable `Closure`.

### Changed
- PHP 8.2+ is now required.
- Replaced compile options array with `Options` object.
- Replaced helper options array with `HelperOptions` object.
- Renamed old `compile` method to `precompile`.
- Replaced `prepare` method with much faster `template` method, and removed dependency on URL include and filesystem write access.

### Fixed
- Rendering data in `{{else}}` of `{{#each}}` (from https://github.com/zordius/lightncandy/pull/369).
- Parsing strings with escaped quotes and parentheses (based on https://github.com/zordius/lightncandy/pull/358).
- Argument count for built-in helpers is now validated.

### Removed
- Custom autoloader.
